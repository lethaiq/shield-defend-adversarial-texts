This example code shows how to  how to use the PWWS attack model to attack BERT on the SST-2 dataset.

def main():
    victim = OpenAttack.loadVictim("BERT.SST")
    # BERT.SST is a pytorch model which is fine-tuned on SST-2. It uses Glove vectors for word representation.
    # The load operation returns a PytorchClassifier that can be further used for Attacker and AttackEval.

    dataset = datasets.load_dataset("sst", split="train[:20]").map(function=dataset_mapping)
    # We load the sst-2 dataset using `datasets` package, and map the fields.

    attacker = OpenAttack.attackers.PWWSAttacker()
    # After this step, weâ€™ve initialized a PWWSAttacker and uses the default configuration during attack process.

    attack_eval = OpenAttack.AttackEval(attacker, victim)
    # Use the default implementation for AttackEval which supports seven basic metrics.

    attack_eval.eval(dataset, visualize=True)
    # Using visualize=True in attack_eval.eval can make it displays a visualized result. This function is really useful for analyzing small datasets.
